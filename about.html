      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>The world is changing. Faith in established systems is crumbling. People prefer opinions to facts. It’s hard to know whom to trust. How can we do better? We’re data scientists and designers, sociologists and strategists, programmers and policy wonks, veterans and upstarts. We’re idealists and realists at the same time. And we all believe that sharing knowledge can help us create a better world. We are Candid. Candid connects people who want to change the world to the resources they need to do it.</p>

      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>For a combined 88 years, Foundation Center and GuideStar each helped change the world by giving people the information they needed to do good.</p>
      <p>But the world faces growing challenges: polarization, climate change, technological revolution, and poverty and inequality. That’s why we combined our talent, technology, data, and leadership to become a new organization, Candid. Now, it’s easier than ever to get the information you need to create change.</p>
